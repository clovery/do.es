10.2 Lexical Environments

A Lexical Environment is a specification type used to define the association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code. A Lexical Environment consists of an Environment Record and a possibly null reference to an outer Lexical Environment. Usually a Lexical Environment is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration, a WithStatement, or a Catch clause of a TryStatement and a new Lexical Environment is created each time such code is evaluated.

Lexical Environment 是规范定义的类型，定义关联标识符 变量和函数，ECMAScript 代码中词法嵌套的结构。

```
LexicalEnvironment = {
  environmentRecord: {}
  outer: {} // outerLexicalEnvironment or null
}
```
